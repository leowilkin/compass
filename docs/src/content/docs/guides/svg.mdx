This is the guide on how to add icons to tabs, or to cards.

You can either use:

- Material Design Icons
- Material Symbols (cards only)
- Material Symbols Light (tabs only)
- Google Material Icons
- Material Design Icons

<Aside>myDay is optimised for use with the Material design pack.</Aside>

<Steps>

1. To find and filter SVG icons, use this link: [Iconify - Material Filter](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/?keyword=material)

2. Once you have found the icon you would like, click on it and press `Copy to Clipboard`.

3. Next, go to my SVG Path Extractor, and paste the contents into it [here](https://svg-extractor.vercel.app/).

4. Then, press `Enter`, or click `Extract Path`, and the new path will be copied to your clipboard. This, you can use as the `{svg}` prop when making cards or tabs.

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">Due to the size of tabs, you must use **Material Symbols Light**.</Aside>
