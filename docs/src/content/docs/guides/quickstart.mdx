import { Steps, Code, Aside, Badge, FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In this guide, we'll run you through how to:

- Download, and install your own Compass instance
- _Customise to match your institution's branding_ <Badge text="Stub" variant="caution" />
- Add your first [tab](/guides/new-tab), and [card](/guides/adding-cards)!

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS version recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installing

<Steps>

1. Clone the Repository

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/leowilkin/compass.git
    cd compass
    ```

2. Move into the App Directory

    ```sh
    cd app
    ```

3. Install Dependencies

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the Development Server

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
</Steps>

The app should now be running locally. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4321/ (or your default Astro port) to see it in action.

## Customising

### Add your first tab

By default, Compass comes bundled with three blank tabs. However, should you wish to start from scratch, here is a guide explaining how to add a custom tab.

A tab is a collection of cards, like Sport, Safeguarding etc

<Steps>

1. Create a new Component in `src/components/Tabs/` in the format `{Tab Name}Tab.astro` by copying the contents of `TemplateTab.astro`

    <FileTree>

    - astro.config.mjs
    - package.json
    - src
    - components
        - Tabs
            - TemplateTab.astro
            - **`{TabName}Tab.astro`**
            - ...
    - pages/

    </FileTree>

2. Replace `{title}` with your title. Do not include the curly braces.

3. Replace `{link}` with the link to the app. Do not include the curly braces.

4. Replace `{svg}` with the SVG path. See `SVG Docs` for more info.

5. Add your tab to the Navbar by going to `src/components/Nav.astro`, and importing the Tab like this:

    <Code code="import {Tab Name} from './Tabs/{Tab Name}Tab.astro'" lang="astro" title='src/components/Nav.astro' />

    and by adding the Tab in the body like this:

    <Code code='<{Tab Name} />' lang="astro" title='src/components/Nav.astro' />


6. Make the page by duplicating the template page named `_template.astro`, and renaming it to the link name.

7. Change the variables in the file in curly brackets. Do not include the curly brackets.

</Steps>

### Add your first card

Next, you'll want to add cards to your page. By default, the template tab comes with a few blank cards, but should you want to learn how to create your own, here is a short guide explaining.

<Steps>

1. Go to the page that you want to add the Card to. e.g. `src/pages/academic.astro`

2. Copy and paste this template structure below the last card:

    <Code code='<Card title=" " link=" " svg=" " />' lang="astro" title='src/pages/academic.astro' />

3. Fill in the details about Title and Link

4. See [SVG Docs](/guides/svg) for information about how to add an icon.

</Steps>
