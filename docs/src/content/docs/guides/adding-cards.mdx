Cards are the links you see on the homepage, and other subject specific pages on myDay.

To create a Card follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Go to the page that you want to add the Card to. e.g. `src/pages/academic.astro`

2. Copy and paste this template structure below the last card:

    <Code code='<Card title=" " link=" " svg=" " />' lang="astro" title='src/pages/academic.astro' />

3. Fill in the details about Title and Link

4. See [SVG Docs](guides/svg) for information about how to add an icon.
