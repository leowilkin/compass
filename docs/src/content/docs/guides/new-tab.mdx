A tab is a collection of cards, like Sport or Safeguarding.

## Instructions

<Steps>

1. Add your tab to the Navbar by going to `src/components/Nav.astro`, and importing the Tab like this:

    <Code code='<Tab title={name} link="{/slug}" svg="{svg} />' lang="astro" title='src/components/Nav.astro' />

2. Make the page by duplicating the template page named `_template.astro`, and renaming it to the link name, e.g `sport.astro`. Make sure to change the extension of the file to `.astro`

3. Change the variables in the file in curly brackets. Do not include the curly brackets.

4. See the next doc page for info on how to add cards to your page.
