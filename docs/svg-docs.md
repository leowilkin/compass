# SVG Documentation
This is the guide on how to add icons to tabs, or to cards.

You can either use:
- Material Design Icons
- Material Symbols (cards only)
- Material Symbols Light (tabs only)
- Google Material Icons
- Material Design Icons

myDay is optimised for use with the Material design pack.

To find and filter SVG icons, use this link: [Iconify - Material Filter](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/?keyword=material)

Once you have found the icon you would like, click on it and press `Copy to Clipboard`.

Next, go to my SVG Path Extractor, and paste the contents into it [here](https://svg-extractor.vercel.app/).

Then, press `Enter`, or click `Extract Path`, and the new path will be copied to your clipboard. This, you can use as the {svg} prop when making cards or tabs.

Due to the size of tabs, you must use Material Symbols Light. If you require support, please contact WILKINL@wellingtoncollege.org.uk
