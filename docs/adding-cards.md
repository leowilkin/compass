# Adding Cards
Cards are the links you see on the homepage, and other subject specific pages on myDay.

To create a Card follow these steps:
1. Go to the page that you want to add the Card to. e.g. `src/pages/academic.astro`
2. Copy and paste this template structure below the last card:
```
            <Card title=" " link=" " svg=" " />
```
3. Fill in the details about Title and Link
4. See `SVG Docs` for information about how to add an icon.
